## Assignment

Use the [diamonds dataset](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/diamonds.html) to answer the questions below.
You can get the data directly from the "data-raw" directory in the [ggplot2 github repo](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/).

## Question 1

Visualize the relationship between "price" and "carat" and comment on the type of model that 
might be appropriate for modeling their relationship.



## Question 2

Investigate logarithmic transformations to see if you can find a more appropriate relationship
between "price" and "carat" for univariate linear regression.
Use data visualization to help justify your choice of model.
Use explained variance score as a metric for model performance, and report training scores based on the entire dataset.

## Question 3

Use the `simple_train_test_split` function below and `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split` 
to evaluate the explained variance of the univariate model using the testing dataset.
Use explained variance as a metric for model performance.
Describe the results and create a visualization that helps explain the differences between the two approaches.
```
def simple_train_test_split(X, y, test_size=.3):
    n_training_samples = int((1.0 - test_size) * X.shape[0])

    X_train = X[:n_training_samples,:]
    y_train = y[:n_training_samples]

    X_test = X[n_training_samples:,:]
    y_test = y[n_training_samples:]

    return X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test
```

## Question 4

Use one-hot encoding to find the best 2-input model by adding either "cut", "color" or "clarity" as a second predictor along with "log(carat)" to model "log(price)". Which 2-input model has the best performance? Report the training score
with explained variance metric, using the entire dataset for both training and evaluation. Compare to the corresponding univariate model in question 2. What's the ".shape" of the feature matrix for the "best" model?

## Question 5

Repeat the analysis of Question 4, this time using 5-fold cross validation.
Report both train and test scores (average +/- standard deviation).
Compare results here with those of Question 4.
Discuss results and explain any significant differences with Question 4.
